# Scenario - Demonstration

This scenario was developed to capture an overview of the NASA Operational Simulator for Small Satellites (NOS3).
It demonstrates the flight software (FSW), ground software (GSW), and simulation interactions within NOS3.
This also serves as a template for additional scenarios to be developed and added to the environment to cover various use cases.

This scenario was last updated on 4/11/25 and leveraged the `dev` branch at the time [95488ce].

## Learning Goals

By the end of this scenario, you should be able to:
* Run NOS3 including FSW, GSW, and simulators
* Send commands and receive telemetry using COSMOS
* Interact with a simulated hardware component
* Verify successful interaction between FSW, GSW, and simulators
* Understand the basic architecture of a NOS3 scenario

## Prerequisites

Before running the scenario, ensure the following steps are completed:
* [Getting Started](./Getting_Started.md)
  * [Installation](./Getting_Started.md#installation)
  * [Running](./Getting_Started.md#running)
* No additional file changes or special setup is needed for this scenario

## Walkthrough

With a terminal navigated to the top level of your NOS3 repository:
* `make`

![Scenario Demo - Make](./_static/scenario_demo/scenario_demo_make.png)

* `make launch`

![Scenario Demo - Make Launch](./_static/scenario_demo/scenario_demo_make_launch.png)

* Organize the windows for ease of use

![Scenario Demo - Organized](./_static/scenario_demo/scenario_demo_organized.png)

* Now we start the COSMOS ground software
  * Click the `Ok` button, followed by the `COSMOS` button in the top left of the follow NOS3 Launcher window that appears
  * Note you may minimize this NOS3 Launcher, but do not close it

![Scenario Demo - COSMOS](./_static/scenario_demo/scenario_demo_cosmos.png)

* By default we went to sun-safe mode and the should be able to confirm that report that multiple ways
  * In the FSW console
    * Lots of logs get captured here as events occur during startup
    * You may need to scroll back in that terminal to view the message
    * Console prints should calm down after initialization as the spacecraft reaches a steady state
  * In GSW telemetry
    * The COSMOS Packet Viewer lets you select the desired Target and Packet and see what has been reported
    * If the text is displayed as pink, that means that no data has been received or that the data has done stale
  * Visually in 42
    * Note you can click and drag within the 42 Cam window to rotate around the spacecraft

### Commanding the Spacecraft

* Let's confirm we can command the spacecraft
  * The CFS CFE_ES_NOOP command has a nice print to  the FSW console to confirm this easily
    * Note you may need to return the FSW console back to the bottom of the window to view
  * Additionally, we can confirm inspect that specific applications command counter in telemetry

![Scenario Demo - COSMOS Command](./_static/scenario_demo/scenario_demo_cosmos_command.png)

* Note the previous command was sent via the DEBUG interface
  * In the above image you can see this in the Bytes Tx column of the COSMOS Command and Telemetry Server
  * This DEBUG interface is if you are physically plugged into the spacecraft, useful for development and test, but not realistic
* Let's command the radio to transmit, by default it must be enabled / disabled for use
  * It is common that the spacecraft radio is always listening for commands, but doesn't transmit unless enabled
  * In the Command Sender let's chang eot use the CFS TO_ENABLE_OUTPUT command
    * The default arguments of DEST_IP 'radio_sim' and DEST_PORT '5011' work for this

![Scenario Demo - TO Enable Output](./_static/scenario_demo/scenario_demo_to_enable.png)

* Note that while we are getting Bytes Rx in the COSMOS Command and Telemetry Server, we don't have Bytes Tx still
  * This is because that standard CFS target utilizes the debug interface
  * Let's send another NOOP, but use the CFS_RADIO target

![Scenario Demo - Radio Command](./_static/scenario_demo/scenario_demo_radio_command.png)

* Things look as expected now in the COSMOS Command and Telemetry Server
  * Let's double check we're actually getting radio telemetry and it matches the debug
  * Open another Packet Viewer window via the COSMOS NOS3 Launcher (third row, first column)

### The Sample Component

* Let's see if we can command the sample instrument payload
  * This is a standard NOS3 component meaning it has FSW, GSW, and a simulator running and talking to the 42 dynamics provider
  * Change the main terminal via the drop down carrot on the right of the primary windows to `sc_1 - Sample Sim` and resize
  * Also prepare the packet viewer by changing to the SAMPLE SAMPLE_HK_TLM packet
  * Send the SAMPLE SAMPLE_NOOP_CC via the Command Sender

![Scenario Demo - Sample NOOP](./_static/scenario_demo/scenario_demo_sample_noop.png)

* We can confirm the FSW console and CMD_COUNT again for the sample component, but nothing in the simulator
  * This is because of the NOOP or No Operation command itself
  * NOOPs are standard across cFS applications and simply prove that that application is alive and listening
  * This does not interface with anything but the FSW application however
* Looking at the sample HK telemetry you may have noticed it has series of `DEVICE_*` telemetry points
  * These are specifically relating to the application talking to the device itself
  * Let's enable the sample application and see what happens

![Scenario Demo - Sample Enable](./_static/scenario_demo/scenario_demo_sample_enable.png)

* The sample simulator now is communicating with the sample application
  * The sample application has scheduled rate at which is requests data from the device
* This is cool, but let's break some stuff
  * Change to the SIM_CMD_BUS_BRIDGE Target in the Command Sender
  * Note that various commands exist, these commands use this special interface called out in the COSMOS Command and Telemetry Server
  * This interface enables us to command the simulators directly so we can see how flight software would respond
  * Let's send the SAMPLE_SIM_SET_STATUS command with a status value of 5

![Scenario Demo - Sample Set Sim Status](./_static/scenario_demo/scenario_demo_sample_set_sim_status.png)

* We successfully told the sample simulator to change it's status to 5
  * We see in the sample sim that it received the command to change status
  * The FSW console shows `Device disabled successfully` and `Request device data reported status error 5`
  * If you dive into the [sample component readme](../../components/sample/README.md) you can figure out why!

### ADCS

* We can leave sample like that, let's place with the Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS)
  * In short, ADCS uses various components to make the vehicle change orientation
  * These components are called typically referred to as sensors and actuators
* Let's first disable the ADCS from doing anything so we can play
  * Note that if you are eclipse your spacecraft can't point at the sun because it doesn't know where it is (not smart enough to guess) 
  * In the Command Sender send the GENENRIC_ADCS GENERIC_ADCS_SET_MODE_CC with GNC_MODE PASSIVE (0)

![Scenario Demo - ADCS Passive](./_static/scenario_demo/scenario_demo_adcs_passive.png)

* The spacecraft appears to be tumbling around more than before now as seen visually in the 42 Cam
  * Note that is was important to command ADCS to passive so that we can poke at the various components it leverages
  * ADCS requests telemetry and sends new commands to these components at 1Hz so it would fight us otherwise
  * Let's command a reaction wheel to spin and see if it does stuff

![Scenario Demo - RW Up](./_static/scenario_demo/scenario_demo_rw_up.png)

* Looks like it! 
  * Let's send a negative torque and see if you can get the spacecraft stable in that axis

![Scenario Demo - RW Down](./_static/scenario_demo/scenario_demo_rw_down.png)

* Close, but this is really tough to do manually
  * We happen to be in the sun again so let's turn back on the ADCS and see if it finishes the job for us
  * Send the GENERIC_ADCS GENERIC_ADCS_SET_MODE_CC with GNC_MODE SUNSAFE_MODE (2)

![Scenario Demo - ADCS SunSafe](./_static/scenario_demo/scenario_demo_adcs_sunsafe.png)

* If you've made it this far, congratulations! 
  * You are now a NOS3 spacecraft operator
