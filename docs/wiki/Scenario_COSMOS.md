# Scenario - COSMOS

This scenario was developed to provide an overview of the Ball Aerospace COSMOS ground software (GSW) as implemented in the NASA Operational Simulator for Small Satellites (NOS3).
COSMOS is a comprehensive ground software suite developed by Ball Aerospace that provides command and control capabilities for embedded systems, particularly spacecraft.
In the NOS3 environment, COSMOS serves as the primary ground software interface.

This scenario was last updated on 5/26/25 and leveraged the `dev` branch at the time [a3e7c100].

## Learning Goals

By the end of this scenario, you should be able to:
* Demonstrate end-to-end command and telemetry processing using COSMOS ground software tools.
* Navigate and utilize key COSMOS applications (Command Sender, Packet Viewer, and Test Runner) within the NOS3 environment.
* Create and execute basic automated test procedures to validate spacecraft functionality.
* Configure COSMOS interfaces for communicating with cFS applications and hardware components.
* Monitor real-time telemetry and analyze spacecraft state.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scenario, complete the following steps:
* [Getting Started](./NOS3_Getting_Started.md)
  * [Installation](./NOS3_Getting_Started.md#installation)
  * [Running](./NOS3_Getting_Started.md#running)
* [Scenario - Demonstration](./Scenario_Demo.md)

## Walkthrough

COSMOS is a suite of applications that can be used to control a set of embedded systems. These systems can be anything from test equipment (power supplies, oscilloscopes, switched power strips, UPS devices, etc), to development boards (Arduinos, Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone, etc), to satellites.

COSMOS implements a client-server architecture with the Command and Telemetry Server and the various other tools typically acting as clients to retrieve data. The Command and Telemetry Server connects to the Targets (green circles) and communicates with them, both sending commands and receiving telemetry (status data). Targets are the items youâ€™re trying to control or from which you're trying to get status. The arrows from the Server to the Targets indicate Interfaces which can be over TCP/IP, serial, UDP/IP, or a custom interface that you define. Yellow boxes indicate data items like configuration files, log files, reports, etc.

While the initial NOS3 demonstration utilized COSMOS, a lot of the specifics were glossed over. As such, we will replicate some portions of prior scenarios below, but go substantially further into detail.
With a terminal navigated to the top level of your NOS3 repository:
* `make clean`
  * Note that we clean here just in case previous files exist from other scenarios now that we have changed the configuration.
* `make`
* `make launch`

First, let's take a look at the COSMOS Launcher.
The launcher itself is configurable to allow removing tools you don't use, or making special buttons specific to your mission.
The [./gsw/cosmos/config/tools/launcher/launcher.txt](https://github.com/nasa-itc/gsw-cosmos/blob/nos3-dev/config/tools/launcher/launcher.txt) contains the specific version used in NOS3 by default.
Looking at that launcher configuration file you can see the top left "COSMOS" button actually does multiple things.

Let's review the components that open when you click the top left "COSMOS" button:
* Command and Telemetry Server:
  * This component is the central communication hub that handles interfaces (primarily UDP in NOS3) and protocols for data exchange with the flight system.
* Command Sender:
  * This component allows operators to search, select, and send commands to targets, with both standard (debug) and RADIO interface options in NOS3.
* Packet Viewer:
  * This component provides a real-time telemetry visualization tool that displays raw and derived telemetry values with automated updates and unit conversions.

Each of these tools has a number of features useful to an operator:
* Command and Telemetry Server:
  * It's important to always have this visible as it will be the fastest means to see if your communications link drops.
  * Additionally if you have red / green limits set, they are displayed in the event log.
  * All commands from the ground are captured here as well. This will allow fairly easy visualization if a script you have running (to automate a pass) has an issue.
  * The other tabs are useful to view specific commands and telemetry, both in human readable form and in raw hex.
* Command Sender:
  * Take note that the top search bar exists; you can type in your command here instead of searching manually.
  * Targets for each component are separated out. In NOS3 we have decided to append `_RADIO` to indicate the correct interface to customarily use for any particular target.
    * The `_RADIO` text indicates that this interface is the one which proceeds in analagous fashion to what an operator of an actual spacecraft would experience; the interface without `_RADIO` simulates being directly plugged into the spacecraft.
  * Note that you may need to resize this window in order to more easily modify the commands (typically try wider first).
* Packet Viewer:
  * Move your mouse over an item or value and observe that comments/relevant text for that item show up on the bottom of the packet viewer.
  * Right clicking an item or value will allow you to:
    * View details with hex values, data types, units, etc.
    * Graph that specific value over time (note by default it uses the meta data time).
  * Note that items with an * prepended are metadata that COSMOS appends to the actual received data. The time provided here is also not from the wall clock; this can be confusing. It is therefore recommended that you use spacecraft time for any analysis instead of the time displayed in the Packet Viewer.

Some additional tools a spacecraft operator should know about include:
* Data Viewer:
  * Text based data visualization of log files, memory dumps, and event messages.
* Telemetry Grapher:
  * Provides graphical representation of telemetry values over time with configurable axes and display options.
* Test Runner:
  * Executes automated test procedures organized in suites, groups, and cases, generating detailed reports of command execution and telemetry verification.
* Script Runner:
  * Uses Ruby to create automated operations procedures, debugging tools, and continuous tasks such as thermal control during testing.

While there are other tools, this should get you through the initial scenario set.
